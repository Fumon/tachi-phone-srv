# Tachiyomi Phone Server

Designed to serve the manga found in the shared storage of [Tachiyomi](link) as dynamically created CBZ files. Works on Android through [Termux](link) for now.

I built this to make it convenient to view Manga on my Kobo Forma since it has an experimental browser which can download files to its library.

Built using rust
